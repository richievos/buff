This is source mostly copied from [makerbase-mks/MKS-DLC32-FIRMWARE/tree/main/Firmware/Grbl_Esp32/src](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-DLC32-FIRMWARE/tree/main/Firmware/Grbl_Esp32/src). Most of the code has been stripped down, so as to avoid depending on the majority of the MKS/Grbl source.

It's here to allow usage of the MKS DLC32 driver board.
