# Buff
A project for building an aquarium alkalinity monitor. Inspired by
[Alkabot](https://github.com/robotfishe/alkabot) and other DIY versions of
this.

The main difference of this implementation versus others is it attempts to use
as much off-the-shelf components as possible. This increases the likely overall
cost of building one some, but makes it easier to build and should make it more
maintainble/debuggable.

This also is meant to be a learning project, so the fact that it's rebuilding
some existing capabilities from scratch is intentional.
